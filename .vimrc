" To make these settings apply to all the files in this project,
" add the lines:
"
" set secure
" set exrc
"
" to your ~/.vimrc file. The first line locks down some of the
" vimrc functionality (shell commands, etc.) in order to prevent
" the project-local vimrc from doing bad stuff. The second line
" is what makes vim read the project-local .vimrc in the first
" place.
