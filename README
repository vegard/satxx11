SAT++11 (A.K.A. satxx11) -- Parallel SAT solver

Here's my attempt at writing a scalable and efficient parallel SAT solver.
Other design goals include compile-time extensibility and customisability
using C++ templates and readable, well-documented code. It also makes
extensive use of the new features in C++11 (hence the name).

NOTE: The solver currently works, but is far from efficient. This is due
to the fact that it is not finished; it can solve small/simple instances,
though.
